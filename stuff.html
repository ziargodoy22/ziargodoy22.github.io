        This website is about Ziar, a student at James Campbell High. Ziar is 15 years of age and is a sophomore. Ziar has lived in the town of Ewa Beach, Hawaii for all his life. His life is very uneventful. He played football for over 5 seasons and stays home on the weekend to indulge is the act of playing video games. This website was made for an AP Computer Science class and is an example of what I can do in html and css.
